Task 1: ith quicksort working
   In code after finding the ith order statistic, it performs a validation step to validate correctness. Have created a copy of the original array and sorts it using the sort() method. Then compared the ith element of the sorted array with the ith order statistic obtained from quickselect.
   If both values match, code indicates that the ith order statistic was correctly identified.

Task 2:
    Implemented Stack, Queue and Linkedlist
    To run Stack, run StackInterface.py and then Stack.py
    To run Queue, run QueueInterface.py and then Queue.py
    To run LinkedList, run LinkedListInterface.py and then LinkedList.py

Output is attached in all files, for task 1 and task 2
